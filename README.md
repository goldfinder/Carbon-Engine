# Carbon Engine
This is a fork of Carbon Engine from roblox (SEE: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/ce-carbon-engine-revolutionary-fps-combat-technology/872472)
This version consists of Local/Server scripts.  clone the scripts and put them into the respective locations and it will work exactly like CE but more advanced with fixes and updates.

* VERSION IS DEOBFUSCATED/CLEANED

## Current Fixes/Patches
- Fixed Head issue (Spamming and swapping to a diffrent weapon messes with deletion of the object that deals with the head movement, this has been updated to also be checked when you equip)
- Patched Mode Changing to use a more traditional code style (Swapped it from always setting all 5 to setting all 5 to 0, then setting the ones that need to be 0.7, to 0.7.
- Fixed issue with reloading and swapping a item (To prevent mass-shooting with RPG's or weapons with higher than expected ammo)
